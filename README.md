# I have created 3 versions of the task management project by mistake.
My aim was just to learn the backend properly and also to create the connection between the frontend, backend and the database. I took the help of ChatGPT as I consider it my closest friend. I created 3 versions by trying again and again. I didn't want to create 3 versions, I just wanted to make the project work properly in every possible way, so I tried and here is the result...
